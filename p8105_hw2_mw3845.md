## Problem 1

###### read and clean the data

``` r
#read and clean the data
subway_df = 
  read_csv('./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv', na = "",
    col_types = cols(
    Route8 = col_character(),
    Route9 = col_character(),
    Route10 = col_character(),
    Route11 = col_character())
    ) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) |>
  mutate(
    entry = ifelse(entry=='YES', TRUE, FALSE)
  )
```

So far, we read and clean the data of NYC’s subway. The data contains
`line`, `station_name`, `station_latitude`, `station longitude`,
`route1` to `route11`, `entry`, `vending`, `entrance_type`, and `ada`.

- Cleaning steps: the variables’ names are converting into lower snake
  case; the 19 variables mentioned above are selected; and `entry` is
  converted into logical variable (`YES` to `TRUE`, `NO` to `FALSE`).
- Dimension: the dimension of resulting dataset is 1868 x 19.

###### Analyze dataset with unique stations:

``` r
uni_station_df = distinct(subway_df, line, station_name, .keep_all=TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    vending = ifelse(vending=='YES', TRUE, FALSE)
  )
```

- How many distinct stations are there?

  *There are 465 stations in the dataset.*

- How many stations are ADA compliant?

  *There are 84 stations are ADA compliant.*

- What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
  entrance?

  *37.7% of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance.
  Note: Here we are not using the unique station data because a station
  might have multiple entrances / exits that the entry w/o vending could
  happen.*

``` r
subway_df |>
  filter(vending == 'NO') |>
  pull(entry) |>
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

###### Reformatting the data to analyze the stations that serves A train:

``` r
# pivot dataframe longer to count A train
longer_uni_station_df = pivot_longer(
  uni_station_df,
  route1:route11,
  names_to = 'route',
  values_to = 'train'
)
# filter the longer dataframe to count ADA compliant A train
a_train_df = longer_uni_station_df |>
  filter(train == 'A')
```

There are 60 distinct stations serve A train. And 17 of the stations
that serve A train are ADA compliant.
